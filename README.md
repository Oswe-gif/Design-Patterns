# Overview

The primary purpose of this repository is to explore and implement a variety of design patterns using C#. Through this project, I aim to deepen my understanding of these patterns and their practical applications in software development. By coding these patterns, I hope to illustrate their benefits, improve my programming skills, and provide a valuable resource for others interested in C# design patterns. 

## Builder
"Builder is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step." [1]
#### Director:
"The director class defines the order in which to execute the building steps, while the builder provides the implementation for those steps." [1]
